# Suddenly in Dostoyevsky

Researchers in Russian literature, have been discussing the surprisingly high frequency of the word _vdrug_ (translating roughly to _suddenly_) in Dostoyevsky's novels. They've been arguing that the unexpected has a central role in Dostoyevsky's works, and many have been counting the uses of the word _vdrug_, to be able to more sharply focus on the nature of that element. We'll do a similar excercise here.

There are structures utilized her that we have not covered yet, and you don't need to worry about those. Your task is to modify the code so that it will produce the expected results. The lines you need to modify are preceded by comments starting with `# MODIFY HERE`.

We'll expand the script in a few steps. First, let's read the text from a file, and count the lines with the word `suddenly` in them. Safe these script files [intros.py](./intros.py) [dostoyevsky1.py](./dostoyevsky1.py) into a directory on your computer, and modify `dostoyevsky1.py` so that it will run without errors. You will also need to load the source text file [the_idiot.txt](./the_idiot.txt) and save it in that save directory.

## Counting "suddenly"



* load a text of dostoevsky's from project gutenberg



## The logic of the program:

* read lines into list
* process elements in list of lines, find word
  * check if word substring in line. 
  * if yes, insert tabs into string


* people associated with
* environment - scenes?
* said by whom?
