# Suddenly in Dostoyevsky

Researchers in Russian literature, have been discussing the surprisingly high frequency of the word _vdrug_ (translating roughly to _suddenly_) in Dostoyevsky's novels. They've been arguing that the unexpected has a central role in Dostoyevsky's works, and many have been counting the uses of the word _vdrug_, to be able to more sharply focus on the nature of that element. We'll do a similar excercise here.

There are structures utilized her that we have not covered yet, and you don't need to worry about those. Your task is to modify the code so that it will produce the expected results. The lines you need to modify are preceded by comments starting with `# MODIFY HERE`.
