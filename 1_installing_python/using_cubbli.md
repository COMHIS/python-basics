## What if I don’t have a laptop?

* You can use the Linux virtual environment provided by the university and accessible from all normal workstations at Aleksandria and other places.
* After logging into Windows normally, navigate to:
  * Start → All Programs → VMware Horizon Client
* In the Horizon Client choose:
  * vdi.helsinki.fi → Cubbli Linux 16
* Wait for Cubbli Linux to start.
* You have access to your normal University desktop, Home-directory, etc. through Cubbli.
* If there are operating system-specific instructions in the rest of these instructions, follow the ones for Linux.
* After you’re finished with using Cubbli for a session, just save your work normally and close the window.
