## Terminal / Console:

Terminal (or console) is a tool for running commands on the computer in an “old school” way. It looks something like this:

When these instructions tell you to type something the terminal, the expectation is that you’ll press enter after typing in the command.

Let’s test and make sure that the Python interpreter works/exists:

1. Open the terminal (follow the instructions for your operating system):
  * Linux (Cubbli)
    * Menu -> Terminal
    * or: bottom row: Terminal-icon
    * or: Ctrl+Alt+t
  * Windows:
    * Start -> Command Prompt (or Komentokehote)
  * Mac:
    * Open the Console command line tool from Applications->Utilities->Console
2. Type `python3`
  * You should see something like this:  
  ```Python 3.4.3 (default, Nov 17 2016, 01:08:31)
  [GCC 4.8.4] on linux
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>
  ```
  * If nothing happens, try typing just `python`
  * Leave Python by typing `quit()`
  * You can close the terminal window whenever you want. Nothing will break.
