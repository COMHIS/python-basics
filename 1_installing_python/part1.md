# Part 1

## Installing Python

As a first step, we will install a programming language, called Python, on your personal laptop. [What if I don’t have a laptop?](./using_cubbli.md) There are all kinds of things to learn about programming languages and the concepts utilized in them, but we will skip those for now, and just focus on getting the environment running. The next step depends on the operating system that you are running. 

* Windows:
  1. download Python 3 installer from  [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2-amd64.exe) .
  2. Run the installer, and make sure to check the box saying “add Python 3.6 to path”
  3. The installer might ask you to change maximum length of path variable. Do that if it does so.
  4. You should be done now. To see if the installation was successfull go to part [“running python in terminal”](./python_terminal.md) in this assignment.
* Linux (Ubuntu):
  1. Test if you already have Python 3 installed by following the instructions at [“running python in terminal”](./python_terminal.md).
  2. If not, follow the instructions at [this askubuntu.com answer](https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get) .
* Mac:
  1. Test if you already have Python 3 installed by following the instructions at [“running python in terminal”](./python_terminal.md).
  2. If you don’t have Python 3 already installed, you can go about in two different ways:
    * SIMPLE (quite ok for now)
      * go to www.python.org, download the python 3.6.2 version from the main page
      * install it
      * you’re go
    * (NOT THAT) COMPLICATED (but useful in the long term)
      * Install XCode (a collection of software development tools for OS). You need XCode to install Homebrew.
      * Install Homebrew (OS software from handling software packages that automatically takes care of dependencies). With Homebrew you can easily install all kinds of software development packages.
      * Install python3 using Homebrew.
      * Full instructions to steps i-iii can be found [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) or [here](http://www.marinamele.com/2014/07/install-python3-on-mac-os-x-and-use-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper.html)  
      (steps Install Xcode and Homebrew and Install Python 3, not necessary to go the Virtual Environments yet)The instructions describe essentially the same steps.
